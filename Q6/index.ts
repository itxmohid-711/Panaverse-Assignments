// Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.

let name = "\t\n Albert Einstine \t\n";
// with white spacing
console.log("Name with whitespaces ",name);
// trimed name/ striped name 
console.log("This is the striped name ",name.trim());
