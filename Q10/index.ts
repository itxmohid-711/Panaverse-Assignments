// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

// I am using a sample code

let institute = "PIAIC" ;
console.log("my institute name is ",institute);

// here I take a veriable named "institute" us store my institute name than, i use log of console to print it.
